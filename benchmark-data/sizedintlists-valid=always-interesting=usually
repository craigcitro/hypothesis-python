# This benchmark is for sizedintlists [integers(min_value=0, max_value=10).flatmap(lambda n: st.lists(st.integers(), min_size=n, max_size=n))], with the validity
# condition "always" and the interestingness condition "usually".
# See the script for the exact definitions of these criteria.
#
# Key statistics for this benchmark:
#
# * 1000 examples
# * Mean size: 574.65 bytes, standard deviation: 818.12 bytes
#
# Additional interesting statistics:
#
# * Ranging from 2 [103 times] to 7081 [once] bytes.
# * Median size: 200
# * 99% of examples had at least 2 bytes
# * 99% of examples had at most 4357 bytes
#
# All data after this point is an opaque binary blob. You are not expected
# to understand it.
